# ðŸ“š Database Notes

## What is a Database?
A **database** stores data in a structured and accessible way, typically with multiple tables containing rows and columns.

## Types of Databases

- **Flat File Database**  
  Stores data in plain text format and consists of a single table.  
  Example: CSV files  
  Suitable for a limited number of records.

- **SQL (Relational Database)**  
  Uses tables that are related to one another.

- **NoSQL (Non-Relational Database)**  
  "Not Only SQL" â€” flexible schema, used for unstructured or semi-structured data.

## Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
Programs that manage relational databases and interpret SQL instructions to create and manage tables.

| **Oracle**   | Owns MySQL, enterprise-grade, used in banking, expensive              |
| **PostgreSQL**| Open-source, often used for web apps                                 |
| **SQLite**   | Lightweight, open-source, no server needed                            |
| **MS SQL Server** | Enterprise-level, commonly used in corporate environments       |

## Tools to Interact with Databases

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
